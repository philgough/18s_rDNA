# 18s_rDNA
Phil's artwork project


## What's new in this version
This version is the 3rd iteration of the concept for the PhD I'm working on.  
It will integrate the data into an interactive dashboard, and remove some of the more confusing or unreliable interactions


## Requirements
I'm building this one with Processing 3, using Michael Heuer's LeapMotion library and my own Poisson Points distribution library (http://perceiving.info/poisson/)

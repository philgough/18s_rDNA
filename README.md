Phil Gough's PhD Installation


## What's new in this version
This version is the 3rd iteration of the concept for the PhD I'm working on.  
It will integrate the data into an interactive installation, and remove some of the more confusing or unreliable interactions


## Requirements
This is built with openFrameworks (moving away from Processing) and relies on several openFrameworks addons.
The installation now uses the Kinect and OpenNI for user-interaction.
